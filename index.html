    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm an <a href="https://ellis.eu/sites" target="_blank">ELLIS</a> PhD student at
        <a href="https://amlab.science.uva.nl" target="_blank">AMLab</a> / 
        <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/" target="_blank">Delta Lab</a> supervised by
        <a href="https://enalisnick.github.io" target="_blank">Eric Nalisnick</a>.</p>

    <p>Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at the
        <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IITP)</a>
        and Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam (UvA)</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My general research interests are in AI safety and responsible AI, aiming to build systems that are maximally useful
        to society with provable guarantees. In my current research, I'm working at the intersection of uncertainty
        quantification and decision making. I'm studying the calibration properties induced by minimizing generalized
        risk measures as an aggregation mechanism.</p>

    <p>Previously, I worked on studying the calibration properties of learning to defer (L2D) systems
        [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/verma22c.html" target="_blank">ICML'22</a>], extending L2D systems
        to allow for multiple experts [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/verma23a.html" target="_blank">AISTATS'23</a>],
        and studying the out-of-distribution behavior of L2D systems (in preparation). I also collaborated on a project
        on the test-time adaption of L2D to new experts
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02683" target="_blank">AISTATS'24</a>].</p>
